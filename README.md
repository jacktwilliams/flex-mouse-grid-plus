# Flex Mouse Grid Plus

## Additions in the 'plus' fork (not in flex-mouse-grid)

This fork adds several enhancements to the original Flex Mouse Grid:

• **Point file loading**: Load and save point collections from files with commands like `points load <filename>` and `points load default`

• **Multi-word point names**: Point names and point file names can now contain multiple words instead of being limited to single words

• **Per-app point file tracking**: The system now remembers which points file was last selected for each application

• **Enhanced unmapping commands**: Added utility commands `unmap word <text>`, `unmap letters <letters> done`, and improved `unmap everything` for better point management

• **Persistent point storage**: Points are now stored in `~/.talon/flex_points/` directory as JSON files

# Original Flex Mouse Grid Readme

A hands-free mouse grid by Ben Rollin, Tara Roys, timotimo, and aegis, for use
with the [Talon voice framework](https://talonvoice.com/). Flex Mouse Grid is
just the latest in a series of iterations, and was built on top of
[Dense Mouse Grid](https://github.com/tararoys/dense-mouse-grid).

You can think of Flex Mouse Grid as extending the functionality of Dense Mouse
Grid, attempting to be an even more flexible, all-in-one voice mouse tool. Some
notable differences from Dense Mouse Grid:

- "Points" mapping. Essentially incorporating Andrew Dant's awesome
  [screen-spots](https://github.com/AndrewDant/screen-spots) tool and adding a
  light UI. It allows points to be saved on an application-specific basis with a
  custom name. Example: `point click continue` to click a saved point called
  "continue".
- "Box" detection. Use image processing techniques to detect boxes on the
  screen, identifying them and allowing you to click them. You can also save
  boxes as points. Example: `boxes` to identify all boxes in the active window,
  and then `box click seven` to click the box labeled "7".

## Installation

1. Ensure you have
   [Talon](https://talonvoice.com/docs/index.html#getting-started) installed.
2. If you haven't already, clone the
   [talonhub/community (formerly knausj_talon)](https://github.com/talonhub/community)
   repository into your Talon user directory. This tool is designed to be used
   along with the community repository, but is compatible with any repository
   that provides the letters a-z using the `<user.letters>` capture and numbers
   using the `<numbers>` capture.
3. Install the python dependencies with the below instructions.

- On Mac or Linux, run these commands in a terminal:

```
~/.talon/bin/pip install opencv-python-headless
~/.talon/bin/pip install numpy
```

- On Windows, run the following commands in a Powershell. Note: on Windows the
  bin folder is a shortcut file that cannot be simply navigated to.

```
cd (New-Object -ComObject WScript.Shell).CreateShortcut("$env:USERPROFILE/AppData/Roaming/talon/bin.lnk").TargetPath
./pip.bat install opencv-python-headless
./pip.bat install numpy
```

4. Clone this repository into your Talon user directory (on MacOS, located at
   `~/.talon/user`).
5. Restart Talon, can't hurt.
6. Try the voice command `flex grid`!

## Learning to use the tool

If you are just interested in the dense mouse grid features, you may consider
just using the simpler
[Dense Mouse Grid](https://github.com/tararoys/dense-mouse-grid). Otherwise, you
can read the following sections on [Points](#points), [Boxes](#boxes), and
finally [Dense Mouse Grid](#dense-mouse-grid-details) to learn about the core
features of this tool.

Note that some of the voice commands for the Dense Mouse Grid have been renamed.
Mostly swapping the order of certain commands like going from `smaller grid` to
`grid smaller`. Feel free to change these back of course!

## Points

Flex mouse grid allows saving "points" which are just labeled points on the
screen. They are always saved relative to the active window, so you can safely
move a window around, and know that points will be unaffected.

### Mapping/unmapping points

- `map <word>` creates a new point at the current location of the mouse cursor
  with the label "word"
- `unmap <word>` deletes the point labeled "word"
- `unmap everything` deletes all points for the active window. Careful with this
  one!

### Showing/hiding point labels

- `points` shows all points for the current window
- `points close` hides all points
- `grid close` hides all points, all boxes, and the dense grid

### Moving to/clicking points

- `point <word>` moves to the point labeled "word"
- `point click <word>` clicks the point labeled "word"
- `point righty <word>` right clicks the point labeled "word"

### Point lists

(Relevant when [mapping boxes as points](#mapping-boxes-as-points)) This is a
list of points all with the same label. You can move to/click the third point in
a point list simply with

- `point <word> three`

Note that the list is 1-indexed. If you omit the index, it is assumed to be one.
Other clicking commands also work in a similar way to the above.

### Mapping points via flex grid coordinates

TODO

## Boxes

For inaccessible programs such as some games where there are visually
distinguishable boxes which you would like a quick way to click, there is the
boxes feature of flex mouse grid. It attempts to identify boxes with computer
vision/image processing, and labels the boxes that it found, allowing you to
interact with them.

Lets take as an example this set of boxes from a game:

![image](images/normal.png)

### Finding boxes

- `boxes` finds boxes labeling each with a number. It attempts to find the
  optimal box detection configuration for the current window

![image](images/boxes.png)

### Moving to/click boxes

- `box <number>` moves the cursor to the specified box, hiding the boxes
  afterwards
- `box click <number>` clicks the specified box, hiding the boxes afterwards
- `box righty <number>` right clicks the specified box, hiding the boxes
  afterwards

### Hiding boxes

- `boxes close` hides all boxes
- `grid close` hides all boxes, all points, and the dense grid

### Mapping boxes as points

Make sure to learn about [Points](#points) first.

- `map <word> box <number>` creates a new point at the center of the chosen box
  labeled "word"
- `map <word> box <number1> mark <number2>...` creates a point list of two
  points. You can include more points by including more `mark <number>`s.
- `map <word> box <number1> past <number2>` creates a point list that will
  include a point for every box in the range between "box number1" and "box
  number2". Can also be done in reverse.

### Example

So if we said `boxes` and saw:

![image](images/boxes.png)

We could say `map sprint box five` to create a point there:

![image](images/sprint.png)

Then we can simply move to the "sprint" button with the phrase `point sprint`

Further, maybe we just want to refer to all of these boxes as actions. We could
say a command like: `map act box thirteen past three` which would create a point
list as seen below:

![image](images/acts.png)

It may be a little hard to tell what's going on, but each box got put into a
point list with the label "act". We could then move our cursor to the same
"sprint" button with the following: `point act nine`.

### Finding more boxes

Box detection works by doing image processing with three configurable
parameters. By default the `boxes` command will attempt to set an optimal
`threshold` parameter, but depending on the color scheme of the window, you may
be able to improve it. The `threshold`, `upper bound`, and `lower bound` can be
configured via voice so that more boxes can be found.

There are three box configuration parameters that are currently changeable:

- `upper` box size upper bound. Boxes will not be larger than this number of
  pixels.
- `lower` box size lower bound. Boxes will not be smaller than this number of
  pixels.
- `threshold` the filtering threshold. The higher the number, the lighter that
  colors can be distinguished.

To see what parameters are already set:

- `flex info` toggles a view of the current grid and box configuration
  parameters

You can modify these parameters on an application specific basis with the
following commands:

- `boxes <parameter> more`
- `boxes <parameter> less`

So e.g. `boxes upper more` would increase the maximum size that a box can be.
After changing any parameter, boxes will be found again so you can gauge if it
was a good change or not in real time. You can additionally modify parameters by
a smaller amount with `bump`:

- `boxes <parameter> more bump`
- `boxes <parameter> less bump`

### More about `threshold`

Hopefully the `upper` and `lower` parameters make intuitive sense, but
`threshold` is probably a little more mysterious. The best way to understand it
is to see what it is doing. You can use the command:

- `boxes threshold`

to toggle an overlay of the processed image. This image will be black and white,
and based on the `threshold` parameter setting, different parts of the image
will be filtered out. Once you have turned on the overlay, you can begin
adjusting the threshold with e.g. `boxes threshold more` and see the resulting
change. This can be a useful way to hone in on the best threshold.

## Dense Mouse Grid details

The Dense Mouse Grid is a completely hands-free replacement for traditional
mousing. It replaces mouse movements with voice commands. You tell the computer
what grid coordinate you want to move to on the screen, and the mouse grid moves
your cursor to that location.

This is the "dense mouse grid". It fills the screen with fields that can be
reached with a number and two letters.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1163925/130808333-219a48b3-650c-4d4c-9a99-d9909011132d.png)

![Video Demonstration of the Dense Mouse Grid](https://youtu.be/d-1BTl72M_s)

### Opening and closing the grid

- `flex grid` to show the grid. It is displayed over the active window by
  default
- `flex grid screen` to put the grid over the whole screen
- `flex grid screen <number>` to put the grid over a different screen
- `grid close` to close the grid

### Basic usage in frame mode

The grid will appear in Frame Mode by default. Say:

- `cap bat`

This will move the cursor to row "c" and column "b". You can include a number to
move the cursor to another block (`3 drum wax`). To click, use whatever voice
command you have associated with clicking. By default in knausj_talon, this is
`touch`.

### Changing your mind

If you have selected the wrong number, you can choose a different number
anytime. If you have selected the wrong row, you can say `row <letter>`, and it
will move the highlighed row to that letter. So saying

- `one`
- `harp`
- `row bat`
- `cap`

will result in moving the cursor to coordinate 1 B C.

### Typing letters or numbers while the grid is open

If you want to type a letter or number while the great is open, you can say
"press" followed by the letter or number.

- `press air` types "a"
- `press bat cap two` types "bc2"

### More modes

If frame mode does not suit you, there are two other modes that can be used to
show the coordinates.

- `grid checker` turns on checker mode, which overlays the coordinates in a
  checker pattern. This can be visually confusing, but it splits the difference
  between being able to immediately see the coordinate and being able to see the
  contents of your screen.
- `grid full` shows every possible coordinate.
- `grid phonetic` switch to phonetic mode, which is just like frame mode except
  with full phonetic words labeling the rows and columns instead of individual
  letters.
- `grid frame` switches to frame mode (the default).

### Grid size

- `grid bigger`
- `grid smaller`

You can adjust the size by a smaller amount by including `bump`, e.g.
`grid bigger bump`.

The default size of the grid can be set in `flex_mouse_settings.talon` by
changing the number in `user.flex_mouse_grid_field_size = "30"`.

### Grid visibility

The grid can be made more or less transparent with the following commands.

- `background lighter`
- `background darker`
- `letters lighter`
- `letters darker`

You can also include the word `bump` to adjust the value by a smaller amount.
For instance, `background darker bump`.

### Grid color

Every color in the grid is modifiable in flex_mouse_settings.talon, allowing you
to set the defaults to whatever is comfortable.

The colors use 6 digit hexadecimal RGB colors. The transparency uses 2-digit
hexadecimal numbers for an alpha channel.

## To do

- Configurable characters: alphabet, alphabet subset, numeric
- Deduplicate grid config state
- Allow clearing saved grid config, box config
- Include more things in grid config
- Pipe image data to new python process as binary
